## Introspection

### Introduction
Hi there! I'm Pavithra Nair. I'm a first year student in Computer Science Engineering. Right from my school days, I was curious to know more about the technical side of stuff. Unfortunately as almost every indian household, I was forced to take up biomath for my 11th and 12th. The two years went by, the only strong thing I had left was my hatred for biology and love for maths. but when it came down to choosing a branch for my engineering, i was sure i wanted to do CSE. 

### Why should we choose you?
Being from a biology background, CS was/is an alien subject for me.  Just one month back, I would have never thought about developing a website or that I am ever capable of doing such things. I believe myself to be a hardworking and dedicated person and these tasks that I did serves as proof for that. To add a little detail, I'm the first in my family to pursue CSE, so I had no one to guide me. I still was capable on doing all these difficult tasks solely from my persistance and mentality to not give up. and ofcourse lots of googling!  

### What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them?
That's a great question. Honestly, I just want to improve my programming skills. I want to work on my logic building for problem solving. I also want to master a programming language other than python. Doing these tasks, I realized CS isn't just looking at the computer screen as lots of codes run through it as we see in movies, I wanna explore all the different domains and find out which fits me. I believe I'm going to keep few hours apart each day for working on these goals. Aside from my academics, I want to improve my interpersonal skills and to make good friends and also to be healthy, both physically and mentally. 

### How will you contribute back to the club?
If I get, I will be an active participant of all the activities and do as much as I can to take the club to more heights. I can assure you I will do my level best to take the club forward. I am open and curious to learn new thing in life, be it, academic or technical. I will be a enthusiastic member

### Thoughts on the task
I'm a beginner to this whole world of programming. Never did I think, I would have to do such tasks in the very beginning dys of my CS life. Looking back, I feel happy and contented as I could reach atleast here, crossing all these unsurmountable tasks. I encountered some challenging tasks, which was entirely anticipated, and I must say, the execution of these tasks was exceptional, solidifying this club's reputation as one of the top student clubs nationwide. The whole experience was fun and somehow good for my self worth.
