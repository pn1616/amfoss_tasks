# Terminal Wizard
I was very apprehensive to start doing the tasks as I was scared of not knowing enough to do the tasks as I have no CS background. But I did anyway, and I'm happy that I could do this task under 2 hours. Also, as a Potterhead, it was refreshing to see all the minute details from the books and movies used as clues. Also had a confusion regarding the element that was first used to create semiconductors. Initially, when I Googled, I got it as silicon and my code was wrong. That sort of wasted a lot of my time. But later, I got it as germanium and voila - I got the final code. Decoded it and got the link. Oh, the relief I felt. *(from the future: now looking back this tasks were so simple, don't know why i was scared)*
