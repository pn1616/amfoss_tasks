# Commands Used
### cd
Used to change the current directory. This command was essential for navigating through directories, and it allowed me to move around using relative paths with ``../``.

### ls
Used to list the contents of a directory. By adding ``ls -a``, I was able to display hidden files as well.

### touch
Utilized to create a new file.

### mkdir
Used to create a new directory.

### python3
Executed this command to run Python scripts directly in the terminal.

### rm
Used for deleting files, and with the ``-r`` option, it allowed me to remove directories recursively.

### vim
Installed and used Vim to edit files within the terminal itself.

### cat
Used to view the contents of a file directly in the terminal.

### cp
Utilized to copy files to a specified destination, and if the destination doesn't exist, it created one with the same name.

# Git Commands Used
### git clone
This command allowed me to clone a repository from a given URL to my local machine, enabling me to work on and view the files locally.

### git checkout <branch>
Used to switch to a different branch in a GitHub repository or to view an existing branch. The ``-b`` option can be added to create a new branch.

### git init
Reinitialized an existing repository or created a new one if none existed.

### git add .
The first step in pushing changes to a repository. It informs Git that I want to include updates to a particular file or directory in the next commit.

### git commit -m <commit message>
Used to provide commit messages when making commits. This command recorded all changes made to the repository since the last push.

### git push origin main
Pushed the changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository.

### git log
Displayed the commit logs of the repository, allowing me to review the commit history. Adding ``--oneline`` made the logs appear in a more organized, one-line format.
