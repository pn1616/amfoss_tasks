# Terminal Wizard 
I was very apprehensive to start doing the tasks as I was scared of not knowing enough to do the tasks as I have no CS background. But I did anyway. and I'm happy that I could do this task under 2 hours. Also as a Potterhead, it was refreshing to see all the minute details from the books and movies used as clues. Also had a confusion regarding the element that was first used to create semiconductors. Initially, when i googled, i got it as silicon and my code was wrong. That sort of wasted a lot of my time. But later i got it as germanium and voila- i got the final code. decoded it and got the link. oh! the relieve i felt.   *(from the future: now looking back this tasks were so simple, don't know why i was scared)*
