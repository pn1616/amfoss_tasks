# Hello, World

I tried seven different programming languages. I watched basic introductory videos for each language and used Google for assistance while writing the code. While working with Ruby and Go, I noticed they were quite similar to Python. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to study Elixir and the other languages as I started late.
