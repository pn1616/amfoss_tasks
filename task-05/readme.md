# Hypertext Mockup Language

I had learned basic HTML previously. I spent a few hours watching a CSS and HTML tutorial. This task had me questioning my whole existence (joking or am I?). The way a simple change in the CSS and HTML could be impactful enough to alter the entire layout surprised me. I thought creating the landing page would be easier than the shopping page, but it was actually the opposite. It took me nearly two days to complete the landing page. Words can't describe how frustrating the entire experience was. My landing page seemed to have a life of its own, undergoing multiple transformations. I will share screenshots of its evolution. If I corrected one thing, somehow something else always changed.   


Creating the shopping page, on the other hand, wasn't as difficult for me. I think organizing all 12 products within a single class called 'product grid' made it significantly easier. Despite the annoyances, it was also a rewarding experience. I had invested so much energy into building this website that I even started dreaming about it. Seriously! Thankfully, I'm not a huge Imagine Dragons fan, otherwise, I might have ended up hating them. üò≠üò≠ Just beginner things! ‚úåÔ∏è
