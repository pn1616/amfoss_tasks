# Hypertext Mockup Language

I had learnt basic html previously. I spent a few hours watching a css and html tutorial. This task had me questioning my whole existence (joking or am i?). The way a simple change in the css and html would fatal enough to change the whole thing. I thought creating the landing page would be easier than the shopping page. But it was actually the opposite. It took me nearly two days to come up with the landing page. Words cant define how frustrating the whole debacle was. My landing page went through its own life. I will share screenshots on its transformation. If I correct one thing, I dont know how but  something else always changes. But then creating the shopping page wasn't that hard for me. I think keeping the whole 12 products in a whole class called 'product grid' made it immensely easy. Yeah, eventhough it was annoying, but at the same time it was a rewarding experience.
