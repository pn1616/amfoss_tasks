# Cricket Vault

I have spent SO MUCH time researching and trying to do it. I have no idea why it has become not possible for me. I think I have the correct code for both the python files. I believe, it is the web scrapping part that has betrayed me. Morever, I'm pushing the things I did for this task. I did install the requirements.txt using ``pip install`` command. I created the virtual environment. activated it using ``source /bin/activate`` command. Also did hell lot of research to write the python files.
