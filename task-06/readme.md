# Cricket Vault

I have spent SO MUCH time researching and trying to do it. I have no idea why it has become impossible for me. I believe I have the correct code for both the Python files. However, I think it's the web scraping part that has been giving me trouble. Moreover, I'm pushing the work I did for this task. I have installed the requirements from the ``requirements.txt`` file using the ``pip install`` command. I created a virtual environment and activated it using the ``source /bin/activate command``. I also conducted extensive research to write the Python files.
