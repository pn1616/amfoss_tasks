# AK-47â„ƒ

This task was not as hard as I thought. With the help of a YouTube tutorial, I successfully obtained the API key and wrote the code for the extensions. The manifest.json file contains the manifest versions, permissions, and icons for the extension in different bytes. Then, I had to create the HTML and CSS pages, which was pretty easy, considering I had spent quite a lot of time trying to complete the hypermockup task.  

The tricky part was the JavaScript file I had to create. I only have basic knowledge of JavaScript, so that took me quite a while. OpenWeatherMap provided the temperature in Kelvin, so I had to fix that by subtracting 273.
