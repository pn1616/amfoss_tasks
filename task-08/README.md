# PokeSearch

This task was quite interesting, as I didn't know much about Pok√©mon and similar games. I had to do a lot of research into it, and the API requests went smoothly. However, I accidentally deleted some code, which caused the buttons to be center-aligned. I know I can redo it and fix everything, but at the moment, the API was working, and the whole game was functional, except for the button alignment issue in the search window. I didn't want to risk messing everything up just for that. I hope that's okay!
