# PokeSearch

This one was interesting as I did not know much about pokemon and there are games like this. Did a lot of research into it and api requests were fine too. I accidently deleted some code and the buttons is centre aligned. I know I can redo it and everything. But it was after my api was working and the whole game was working all of a sudden, the only issue is the buttons were not center aligned in the search window. I did not want to mess everything up just for that. Hope that's okay!
