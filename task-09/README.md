# GeoQuest

I installed Flutter for this task. Understanding Dart wasn't easy for me, and I encountered issues with the map functionality. I dedicated around three days to try different code alterations and make it work. However, as the deadline approached, I decided to drop this task. Instead, I focused on completing a few additional tasks and adding final touches to the tasks I had already worked on.  

- installed flutter
