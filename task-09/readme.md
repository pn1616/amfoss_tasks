# GeoQuest

I was so burnt out by this time, as I was working double the time to catch up with the two weeks that I lost as I did not have ubuntu. I installed flutter. Understanding dart was not easy. The map is not working for me either. But I tried for like three days, altering code and trying to make it work. But as the deadline was approaching, I dropped the task. I continued with a few additional tasks and adding in final touches to the tasks I already did. 

- installed flutter
